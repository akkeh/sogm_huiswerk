    \frametitle{Background:} 
    There are several indications that music and speech share a common history in evolution. Altough the brainstructures processing speech and music appear to operate independently (left hemisphere being laterized for speech, right hemisphere for music (Kolb \& Whishaw, 1947; Marin \& Perry, 1999; Peretz, 2006)), there are many similarities how the brain is activated while interpreting speech and music (Zatorre et al., 1994; Trehub et al., 199).

The purpose of my project is to create a system to investigate the similarities of speech and music processing. The focus will be the identification of a sound as either 'noise' or speech. And than to see whether this system will identify music as either 'noise' or speech.

\begin{frame}   % begin: outline
    \frametitle{Outline:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The plan is to program a neural network and;
        \item to train it to distinguish speech from 'noise'.
    \end{itemize}
    After the system proved successful at discriminating between speech and 'noise':
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Test the abilities to discriminate music from 'noise'
    \end{itemize}

    Input - Output
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Single trial:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item input: a soundfile (preclassified)
            \item output: classification as: speech or 'noise'
            \item when learning the classification will be compaired to the expected result (feedback)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Full learn cycle:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item input: collection of preclassified soundfiles
            \item output: percentage of correct classification (learning curves?)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Final trials:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item input: collection of musicfragments
            \item output: percentage classified as speech and percentage classified as 'noise'
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{What will I learn?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How to program neural networks
        \item Make an enviroment to schedule multiple trials
        \item Programming with an scientific approach
        \item What data manipulations are needed to get usefull input
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}     % end: learning

\begin{frame}   % begin: planning
    \frametitle{Approach:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Delve into neural networks (Coursera course, university webpages, etc.)
        \item Investigate and select usefull sound descriptors to use as input
        \item Collect a corpus of test material
    \end{itemize}
